## Problem 1: Minotaur’s Birthday Party 
### Approach: 
- Each time a guest enters for the first time they will always eat the cake
- Every time after they do not eat the cake but will call the waiter if there is no cake
- Given that there are N number of guests, the Minatour can count the number of times the server is called and when the server is called N number of times he will know that every guest has entered atleast once

## Problem 2: Minotaur’s Crystal Vase
### Chosen approach to code: 3 queue
### Strategy Discussion:
#### Strategy 1
With this method, there is no orginizated way for guests to know who should enter next in the event that many guests would want to see the vase which leads to a situation where not every guest is guaranteed to see it. One advantage of this would be that there is no necesary pre-party planning needed.
#### Strategy 2
