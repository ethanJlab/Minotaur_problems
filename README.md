# Minotaur_problems

## Problem 1
### Approach:
- Each time a guest enters for the first time they will always eat the cake
- Every time after they do not eat the cake but will call the waiter if there is no cake
- Given that there are N number of guests, the Minatour can count the number of times the server is called and when the server is called N number of times he will know that every guest has entered atleast once
